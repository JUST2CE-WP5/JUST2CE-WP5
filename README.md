[JUST2CE](https://just2ce.eu/) is a reserach project funded by the European Union’s [Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/101003491) under grant agreement No 101003491. It aims at understanding, in a critical and thoughtful way, under which conditions a responsible, inclusive and socially just transition to a circular economy is possible and desirable, what technical, geopolitical and social factors can  enable  or  hamper  such  transformation  and  how  these  aspects  can contribute to the development of transitional policy measures. ​

The project has identified enablers and barriers to Circular Economy in a number of key strategic sectors – selected among those indicated by the EU Action Plan for Circular Economy – such as food production and waste, water management, critical raw materials and production in complex global supply chains. The results of this analysis have been used to develop a decision support system and macroeconomics analytical tools to design new or improve existing Circular Economy practices. ​

The aim of **Work-Package 5** (WP5) is twofold:

1. To provide a systematic review of the current literature on macroeconomic models for assessing the transition toward a circular economy.

1. To develop a formal model or set of models to simulate and compare alternative circular economy practices, policies, and transition scenarios.

This is the **official repository** for the (multi-area) input-output stock-flow consistent ecological models that have been developed in WP5. Main contributors are [Josè Bruno Ramos Torres Fevereiro](https://github.com/JoseFevereiro), [Andrea Genovese](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/management/people/academic-staff/andrea-genovese), [Oriol Valles Codina](https://github.com/parvulesco), and [Marco Veronese Passarella](https://github.com/marcoverpas).
